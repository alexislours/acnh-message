"101","Happy Valentine's Day! I'm ever
so thankful for our friendship,
especially today. I must confess,
I got you a small something. I do
hope it finds you well, darling.
May you have a lovely day!"
"102","Happy Valentine's Day! Oh, I must
say...this holiday does make my
heart flutter like a butterfly. Now,
I wasn't quite sure what to get you,
but I do hope this surprises and
delights, darling."
"103","How could I have known that we
would become such friends,
confidantes, or ""besties,"" as some
might say? Darling, I couldn't have
predicted it, but I'm so happy that
we have. Please accept this."
"104","I'm just writing to say thank you
for always being such a kind friend
to me. Valentine's Day comes but
once a year, so I'm sending a little
something special with this missive.
I hope it finds you well!"
"105","You do know that today is special,
don't you? It's Valentine's Day, and
we must tell the folks dearest to
us just how we feel. So! I want to
remind you how thankful I am for
your friendship. This is for you!"
"106","Happy Valentine's Day! I'm quite
sure you've received many letters
much like this one. And each and
every one well deserved! Still, I
hope this one finds a special place
in your heart, as you have in mine."
"107","Happy Valentine's Day! You're so
kind to me, so I'm giving you a little
something in return. I hope our
friendship continues to blossom
like a drop of red food coloring in
seltzer. Yes, that simile will do."
"108","It's Valentine's Day, and that means
I am cutting loose with exclamation
points in all my cards! I hope this
one finds you well, and I have
attached a small token of my
appreciation for you! Enjoy!"
"109","You always make my day brighter,
so I hope this note makes your
Valentine's Day just a smidgen
more luminous. Please accept a
small token of my friendship. It's
very nearly the least I can do!"
