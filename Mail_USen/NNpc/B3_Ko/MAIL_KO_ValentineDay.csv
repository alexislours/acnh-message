"001","Hey there, n\0!"
"002","Today's the day, n\0."
"003","Special delivery for n\0!"
"004","Say, n\0,"
"005","Dear n\0,"
"006","How are ya, n\0?"
"007","Hello, n\0!"
"008","2\0n\0!"
"009","So, n\0..."
"101","Happy Valentine's Day, kiddo! I've
been keepin' this around to give to
someone special, and I've decided
that someone's you. Yeah, yeah,
I know. Just don't go gettin' all
sappy on me, y'hear?"
"102","Somehow Valentine's Day got the
drop on me. But I was ready with
my one-two punch: gifts and kind
words for those special to me. That
means you, kiddo! Thanks for bein'
you. Enjoy the present."
"103","Now, I'll be the first to admit that
givin' out roses ain't my style—but
then again, it's Valentine's Day, an'
if ever there was a day for makin'
an exception... Anyhoo, I hope this
brings a smile to ya, kiddo."
"104","I'm no good at this Valentine's Day
claptrap, so bear with me... Happy
Valentine's Day to a swell someone
in my life. That'd be you. Huh! That
didn't come out so bad! I reckon
you just inspire that in me."
"105","This is a smidge too embarrassin'
for me to say out loud, so I wrote
it out on this Valentine's Day card
instead: thanks for always bein' so
kind and warm. I'm truly lucky to
know ya, kiddo!"
"106","I reckon you've got Valentine's Day
gifts pilin' up from here to the
stars. Well, have another! You're
too good a neighbor for me not to
celebrate, so I got you something
I hope you'll enjoy."
"107","Seein' as it's Valentine's Day and
all, there's something I feel I don't
tell ya near enough: you're just
about the best neighbor this
n\0 could ask for. Thank you
for bein' swell, n\0."
"108","How goes your Valentine's Day?
Told anyone how you feel about
'em yet? Not that I have, mind...
but I'm about to, right here in this
letter. Thanks for being a great
neighbor and an even greater pal."
"109","I used to think it was crass to jam
all your feelings onto a piece of
paper instead of saying 'em out
loud, but here we are. I know most
times I seem grumpy, but I'm always
thankful I'm pals with you, kiddo."
