"101","So, 'cause today's Valentine's Day,
I decided to go all out and get you
something real special. You've
always been a total rock star to
me, so I wanna make sure I treat
you like one today. Enjoy!"
"102","Happy Valentine's Day! So check
it out—I made sweets, and they're
actually good! I know, right? Bwa
ha ha! Anyway, I was so proud,
I just had to share. Call it my
thanks for always being rad."
"103","We're pals, right? I mean, of course
we are. But, like, forever pals. Well,
I feel we are, which is why I got
you something I think you'll like.
'Cause if we're in it forever, we
gotta be good to each other, right?"
"104","Were you surprised? Yup! You
were. Let's keep it going. I got you
chocolate 'cause it's Valentine's
Day! Are you gonna love it? Yeah,
you will. Isn't being my pal great?
I think you know the answer."
"105","Didja think I'd forget about you on
Valentine's Day? Come on! You're
like the island rock star. No way I'd
forget! And to prove it, I got you
something I think—I mean, KNOW—
that you're gonna love."
"106","OK, so I thought I'd try making
chocolate. I know, I know. Really
bad idea. But get this: it came out
awesome! Anyway, I'm sending you
some for... Oh, hey, it's Valentine's
Day. Huh! Well, that worked out!"
"107","I'm sending out chocolate to some
of my favorite folks, and guess
what? You made the list (as if there
was any doubt)! Thanks for always
being so chill. I can NEVER have
too much of that in my life."
"108","Happy Valentine's Day! So, I was
thinking... What do you get for the
neighbor who deserves everything?
Then it hit me. You can never have
too much chocolate. And here we
are! Enjoy your chocolate!"
"109","Why do folks think Valentine's Day
gifts have to mean, like, STUFF?
I mean, what if I just wanna give
something awesome to someone
I think is awesome? What I'm saying
is, you're awesome. Enjoy!"
