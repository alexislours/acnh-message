\0 Pretty great how pumped
up everyone is today, huh? 
\0You gotta
love Festivale!\0\0('촀\0Morning-jog energy levels won't cut
it today. 
\0If you're not sweating,
you're not doing it right!"
"002","(촀\0Confetti's not the only thing in the
air.
\0 If you see a feather float by, grab
your net and swing for the fences!\0\0(촀\0I'm challenging myself to a feather-
catching contest. 
\0So far, I'm in the
lead, but I'm right on my tail!"
"003","(2촀\0OK, I know how this is gonna sound,
\0
but I'm trying to figure out which
feather color is the heaviest.\0\0(%촀\0I have most of 'em.

2\0}\0Ā.\0\0(\0촀\0If you catch one and you can spare
it,
\0(""촀\0 sprint by, and maybe we can do
some trading, n\0."
"005","(촀\0Flashy outfits help you stand out,
which means more eyes on your
rippling abs. 
\0No complaints here.\0\0(7촀\0Nothing to stop you from wearing it
every day either. 
\0It's always a good
time for dance cardio, n\0!"
"006","(6촀\0You're looking buff in that outfit,
n\0.
\0 I'm easily your
biggest rival though.\0\0It takes perfectly balanced triceps
and biceps to pull this look off.
\0(5촀\0
Needless to sayn\0\0
\0I'm rocking it."
"007","That \0Pavé\0￿ sure knows how to move.

It's easy to get distracted, but don't
forget dancers are beasts too.\0\0(촀\0I bet he's got a full six-pack and
quads for days under all those
fancy sequinsn"
"008","(촀\0Having fun, n\0?
\0
Today's Festivale, so you've gotta
dance like you're lifting weights!\0\0(7촀\0I don't exactly know what that
means, but do that today, and your
hamstrings will thank you tomorrow."
"009","(&촀\0Netted any \02\0Ā촃rainbow feathers\0￿ yet?
\0
I've been on the lookout, but so far,
no luck, n\0.\0\0(촀\0Whenever I spot one, I do a victory
dance, grab my net, andn\0\0
\0it's gone.
\0
I should really work on my approach."
"010","(촀\0Check out my dance moves!
\0
My footwork is superb, and my
musculature speaks for itself.
(촀\0The plan is to dance all day long.
\0
See if you can keep up! 
\0It'll be
fun, n\0!"
"011","A whole day of chasing after feathers
and dancingn\0\0
\0(촀\0 Festivale makes for an
amazing workout!
()촀\0Trying to spot the feathers pumps up
your eyes too. 
\0Eye muscles are a
waaay under-pumped muscle group."
"012","(촀\0Festivale has arrived! 
\0I can't wait to
dance until my feet fall off. 
\0Or maybe
just until I hit my step-count target.\0\0(촀\0Follow me, and we'll get this island
groovin'! 
\0No better time than now!"
"013","(촀\0My PASSION knows no bounds!
\0
If you can keep up with my lightning-
fast pace, we'll win the day for sure!"
"014","(6촀\0Hope you've been pacing yourself.
\0
Nighttime is when the champs
come out to play!\0\0(촀\0I've still got plenty in the tank, so
if you need some fitspiration, look
no further."
"016","(촀\0Everyone's dancing their hearts out.
\0
You can almost smell their effort
from in here!\0\0(촀\0Oh non\0\0
\0 Now that effort's all up in
my nose, I'm finding it hard to
stay still, n\0!"
"017","(7촀\0If you're gonna go all out with the
dancingn\0\0
\0and I know you aren\0\0
\0
be sure to rest now and then.\0\0()촀\0After all, Festivale is more of a
marathon than a sprint. 
\0That means
you've gotta pace yourself!"
"018","()촀\0Listen, Champ. 
\0As your Buffness
Coach, I want you to know it's
important to take breaks.\0\0(촀\0Use that time to work on posing.
\0
If you don't nail the poses, your
dancing will suffer. 
\0(촀\0Your gains too!"
"019","(9촀\0I've been doing secret training after
my normal training to try and catch

cool \02\0Ā촃rainbow feathers\0￿ yet?\0\0()촀\0They're rare, but just like those hard-

extra effort, n\0."
"021","(촀\0What a great start to the day!
\0 I've
been raring to go for weeks now.\0\0(촀\0I know I'm in tip-top shape, but don't

warmed up and ready to make some
moves and take some names!
