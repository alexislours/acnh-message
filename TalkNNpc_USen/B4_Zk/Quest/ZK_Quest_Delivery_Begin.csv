촀\0Heyyyy, you know what? 
\0(촀\0I just
realized that you're friends with
s촀 too!
(7촀\0Well, I borrowed something from
2촀himher\0 a looooong time ago, and I
keep meaning to return it.
(3촀\0So, umn\0\0I know it's a cool story,
but I was actually wondering if you'd
be interested in returning it for me."
"001_a","(\0촁\0I could do that."
"001_b","(\0촁\0Sorry, not interested."
"002","(촀\0Get this!
\0 I had s촀
over to visit a while ago, and 2촀heshe\0
left something at my place.
(7촀\0I want to get it back to 2촀himher\0 right
away, but I'm, like, way behind on
촀 today."
"002_a","(\0촁\0I could do it for you!"
"002_b","(\0촁\0Sorry, not interested."
"003","(촀\0I don't know what's going on with
the mail service here, but I got a
package for s촀!
('촀\0I'd mail it back but who knows
where it'll end upn"
"003_a","I'll deliver it!"

"004","(촀\0Yeah? 
\0Really?
\0 (6촀\0Well, n\0!
I felt kinda bad about asking but
not TOO bad, obviously."

\0thank you so much!"
"006","(9촀\0You are the best.
\0( (%촀\0Here you go!"
"007","(촀\0Yeah, I should probably handle this
myself. 
\0Good call.\0\0(4촀\0It'll be embarrassing, but now that
I've talked to you, it's already out
there and I'm over it somehow."
"008","(촀\0Ah, no worries. 
\0I've been meaning
to go see s촀 anyway."
"009","( 촀\0You think?
\0( (촀\0Wait, you're being
sarcastic!
\0 (촀\0Ha HA! 
\0Nice one."
"101","(촀\0Hey, I've got a favor to ask you!\0\0(7촀\0So, I got a little something for
s촀.
\0 Not a big dealn\0\0
\0
(촀\0But I'm TRYING to make it a big deal!
(%촀\0I thought maybe if you gave it to
2촀himher\0 for me, it'd be a big surprise
production kind of thing. 
\0Yeah?"
"101_a","Sure!"
"101_b","(#촁\0Sorry, not interested."
"102","(촀\0Oh, n\0!
\0 Will you
listen to the plea of a tortured soul?\0\0(촀\0OK, I'm probably being melodramatic,
but I got into a prank war with
s촀 a while back.
(
촀\0And, well, I'm not sure who won
the war, but I've been feeling bad
about some of the things I did.
(8촀\0I even got 2촀himher\0 a present, but I'm
too shy to deliver it. 
\0Any chance
you could help me out?"
"102_a","I got this."
"102_b","Sorry, I can't."
"103","(촀\02\0n\0, that's awesome!

I can already see s촀
reacting. 
\0(촀\0Classic s촀!
(촀\0Well, here it is.
\0 Good luck!"

nice I had to thank you thrice!\0\0(""촀\0Say hello to s촀 for
me, would you?"
"105","(촀\0Oh, please. 
\0Don't be sorry!
\0 I'm the
one who just dropped this on you
out of nowhere.
(촀\0No, I'll just have to go talk to
s촀 myselfn"
"106","(촀\0Yeah, I guess I should probably
be the one to face the music
anyway, n\0.
(촀\0What I'm saying is that
s촀 is going to
prank me with loud musicn"

deliver that today, that'd be great.\0\0(촀\0Oh, I forgot a comma. 

to say ""No, RUSH!"""
"109","(
촀\0Actually, it's getting a bit late today,
so you can go ahead and deliver
that tomorrow if you want."
"201","(촀\0I asked you to deliver something to
s촀, remember?
\0( (촀\0Ugh,
I'm so nervous about the responsen"

she's\0 getting by without
it for nown"

for me, remember?\0\0(7촀\0I hope s촀 isn't too
worried about it."

s촀 with a gift,
remember?

pranked again by delivering an
apology gift to s촀."
