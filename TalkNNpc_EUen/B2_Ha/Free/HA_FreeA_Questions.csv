"015","(촀\0Hey! I've got a totally built question
for you—(촀\0which muscles would you
rather work on, n\0?"
"015_a","My biceps."
"015_b","My triceps."
"015_c","My quads."
"015_d","My delts."
"016","()촀\0That choice says a lot about
you, n\0.\0\0(%촀\0The bent-arm biceps pose is a classic

you, n\0.\0\0(%촀\0The bulgy biceps tend to get the
glory, but you choose the triceps—

doesn't mind showing support from
the sidelines."
"018","()촀\0That choice says a lot about

really good at fundamentals
like kindness and honesty."

there.
