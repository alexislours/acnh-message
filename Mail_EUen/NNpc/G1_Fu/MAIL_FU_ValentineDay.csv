"101","When I think of Valentine's Day,
your sweet face pops into my head.
Thanks for being such a wonderful
friend. Here's a little gift to
express how much having you in
my life means to me."
"102","Happy Valentine's Day! This is a
day for treating the folks who are
special to us. For me, that list
wouldn't be complete without you.
Let's promise to be friends forever
and always. "
"103","It's Valentine's Day, which is the
perfect time to shower the ones
you love with cards and presents.
I hope you know how very special
you are to me!"
"104","I got the itch to give you a little
something for Valentine's Day,
but when I thought about doing it
in person, I got all nervous.
Situations like this are why the mail
exists, so here you go!"
"105","It's Valentine's Day, so I wanted to
express my gratitude for all that
you do. This gift is tiny when
compared to the size of my regard
for you, which is immeasurable."
"106","It's finally Valentine's Day! 
I've been saving up all of my nicest
thoughts to send you along with
this gift. Can you feel the warmth?
I sure hope so. No matter what
happens, let's always be friends."
"107","Since it's Valentine's Day, I wanted
to send along a little note and gift.
Do you like them? It's been a joy
getting to know you, and I hope our
friendship continues to blossom
into a lovely friend flower. "
"108","It's Valentine's Day! This isn't
much, but it reminded me of you,
so I wanted you to have it. If it's
OK with you, I hope our friendship
continues to grow. "
"109","Happy Valentine's Day! This special
day only comes once a year, so I
won't waste it. Here's a gift to
show how happy I am to know you.
Thanks for being my friend!"
