"101","Valentine's Day is a time to say the
stuff you're usually too shy to say.
I'm not too shy to say anything, so
I'll just say it louder. YOU'RE
SUPERDUPER SPECIAL TO ME! 
Eep! My cheeks are all red now!"
"102","Happy Valentine's Day! Thanks for
being the very best bestie. These
are the most special chocolates of
all time, and they're just for you.
Enjoy! "
"103"," Happy Valentine's Day 
Did you know today's all about
sending chocolate to your favorite
folks? Well, it is! That means you,
bestie. We'll be friends forever
(and ever and ever and ever)."
"104"," Happy Valentine's Day! 
I was thinking about who to send
this to, and then it hit me. Who am I
most grateful for? Who makes my
cheeks hurt from smiling? Whose
star is nearly as bright as my own?"
"105","You've been waiting for this treat,
haven't you? At long last, it has
arrived! This gift is sweet, and so
are you, so... Enjoy reveling in
that sweet sweetness! "
"106","This chocolate is special because
it's filled with love from me to you.
Don't worry, you can totes still eat
it! Thanks for being a good friend
and my most devoted fan."
"107","Happy Valentine's Day! 
Our friendship is like my stardom...
always rising higher and shining
brighter! This chocolate is a tasty,
melty symbol of that (but hopefully
our friendship lasts longer)."
"108","Happy Valentine's Day!  I feel like
we've got a good thing going, you
and I. You know what else is good?
YUMMY CHOCOLATE. So here's
some of that, straight from my
heart to your tummy."
"109","It's Valentine's Day! You don't have
to say a thing. I know you've been
waiting for a gift from yours truly.
This is full of warmth and affection
and, most especially, chocolate.
Thanks for your undying support!"
