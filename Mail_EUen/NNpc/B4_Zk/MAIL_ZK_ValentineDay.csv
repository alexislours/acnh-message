"001","To my closest friend,"
"002","Dear n\0,"
"003","To my Valentine's VIP n\0,"
"004","Sweet n\0,"
"005","Fun fact, n\0..."
"006","2\0n\0!"
"007","To n\0,"
"008","Yo, n\0!"
"009","Hey, n\0..."
"101","No matter how much time we spend
together, I can never get enough.
You're like my favorite TV show, in
human form! Anyway, I got you a
little gift. Can't wait for the next
episode. Ha HA!"
"102","Your smile makes me as happy as
the most expensive fragrance that
I own. Speaking of fragrances,
I hope this little gift tickles your
nose's fancy! Happy Valentine's
Day, n\0!"
"103","I know, I know... Giving someone a
bunch of red roses feels serious,
but that's because it IS! I take our
friendship as seriously as an
audition, so you know you can
count on me to overdo it. Ha HA!"
"104","Is that a weird way to start the
letter? Sorry, it's just that it's
Valentine's Day and you're always
sweet to me. Also, I was just eating
촀, so it was on my
mind. Happy Valentine's Day!"
"105","Every time I think of you, a rose
blooms in my heart. OK, maybe it's
not a ""fact,"" but it's fun, right?
Anyway, I figured I'd get you some
roses for Valentine's Day since you
always make me smile."
"106","Happy Valentine's Day! I made a
flower bouquet that represents all
the great memories we've made
together. Let's make more of them,
and maybe 2\0촀 album
while we're at it!"
"107","Happy Valentine's Day! You know
how they say that you should stop
and smell the roses? Well, I gotchu.
You can smell these babies all day,
n\0! I hope it's a happy
one for you."
"108","You're always so nice to me, so I
just had to write and say, ""Happy
Valentine's Day!"" I hope you heard
it in my voice—that means the
branding is working. Ha HA!
Anyway, you're the best."
"109","You know what today is, right?
It's Valentine's Day! At least, it
was when I wrote this. I want you
to smile right...NOW! And know
that I'm probably smiling too,
wherever I am. Probably shopping."
