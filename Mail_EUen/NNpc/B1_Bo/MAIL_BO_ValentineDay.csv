"101","Today's the day we get to give
candy and stuff to folks who make
us feel good. So I got you a buncha
chocolates! Then I gave 'em a big
ol' happy hug so they're packed
with my good feels."
"102","Did you know feelings can actually
make chocolate taste better? It's
science. Chocolaty science. Which
is the best kind of science! That's
why I packed these chocolates all
fulla my happiness. 'Cause flavor!"
"103","Valentine's Day is the day you're
supposed to send gifts to your
favorite folks, and 'cause you're
one of my favoritest folks, I'm
sending you a special gift 'cause
it's Valentine's Day!"
"104","Someone said Valentine's Day is
when I've gotta tell everyone how I
feel about them, so here goes...
You make me happy, and I'm glad
you're my friend. Also! Writing that
made me happy. And kinda hungry."
"105","Yesterday I was thinking about how
fun it is to chat and hang out with
folks, and it made me think of how
fun you are to chat and hang out
with! So then I got you a gift for
Valentine's Day and wrote this."
"106","Wanna know how great I think you
are? I bought chocolates for you,
and I only took one nibble before
I sent 'em. One! Huh...that sounds
real grown-up now that I've written
it out like that."
"107","Ah huh huh huh huh...huh huh huh
huh huh huh huh. Ah huh! Huh huh
huh, huh huh? Huh. Huh huh. Ah
huh huh huh huh huh—huh huh!
AHH HUH HUH HUH! Huh huh huh...
Huh— Happy Valentine's Day!"
"108","If this letter smells kinda funny, it's
'cause I've had it under my pillow
for weeks. I wanted it to soak up all
my happy thoughts of you, but,
uh...it soaked up my smells too.
Oh well. Happy Valentine's Day!"
"109","OK, I get that Valentine's Day is
about telling special folks in your
life how you feel, but...why do you
wanna know I feel sleepy right
now? Oh well! I told you, and that
means you're special to me."
