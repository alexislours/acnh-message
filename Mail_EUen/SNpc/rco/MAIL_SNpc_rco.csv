"101","We've completed the expansion of
your lovely home. However, during
construction, we had to place one
or more wall-hanging items in your
storage. Hope you understand."
"102","I appreciate how you've helped
prepare homes for new island
residents. As a thank-you gift, I've
included some fencing for your
home. Good fences make good
neighbors, after all!"
"103","A new resident moved to a plot you
set up! As a small token of our
appreciation, we've put 1,000 Nook
Miles into your account. We hope
you spend them on something that
makes you happy."
"104","Oh my! I'm feeling the music! So
glad you came to K.K.'s concert.
His memorable song Welcome
Horizons is my gift to you. Pop
it into an item that can play music,
and enjoy it whenever you like!"
"105","To celebrate the opening of the
new Resident Services building, we
have lots of new miles-redemption
items available. Plus, we now have
a new service for Nook Miles+
members to earn 5x more miles!"
"106","I'm writing to advise you of some
special Nook Miles+ activities that
are available from now until May
4th. All part of our Nature Day
event! Yes, yes! I do hope you'll
come see me for more details, hm?"
"107","I would like nothing more than to
give you this gift in person, but
with Resident Services under
construction, I've decided to leave
your May Day Ticket with Orville.
I hope you enjoy your excursion!"
"108","Great news! We've confirmed that
the waters around our island are
safe for swimming, so we're
offering a new line of wet suits for
sale. You can swim, dive, or simply
kick back in your new suit. Enjoy!"
"109","Hello, hello! I have a gift for you.
These are the customization kits
from my customization workshop!
I hope you enjoy being able to add
your own custom, personal touch
to things. DIY sure is fun, hm?"
"110","All-new body paint and eye color
options are available as Nook Miles
redemption items at the Nook Stop
in Resident Services. We hope you
enjoy making all kinds of fun, new
looks for your next costume party!"
"111","We're pleased to announce a new
feature available to any homeowner
whose house has reached maximum
size: expanded storage! If you're
feeling tight on space, please visit
Resident Services to learn more."
"112","Construction on your home-storage
expansion is complete! We know
it's no fun running out of storage,
so we're glad to be able to offer
additional peace of mind."
